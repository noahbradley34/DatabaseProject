# DatabaseProject

Hello, welcome to my Database Project for Oakland University's CSI 3450 database desgin and implementation course.

This project centers around NCAA Men's Basketball, and through the use of a UI and Database, a user can access statistics for the
2018 - 2019 season.

The UI was built in Netbeans IDE 8.2, while the database was built in mySQL Workbench 8.0 CE.

Attached as well is the several excel files used as a "middle man" approach to importing the data into mySQL. They are not
a download requirment.

System requirments:

  Netbeans IDE 8.2, 
  
  Javafx plugin, which can be installed within Netbeans,   
  
  mySQL Workbench 8.0 CE, 
  
  mySQL JBDC Driver, which can be installed within Netbeans

Back End Steps:

Download the nbproject folder, src folder, and the mySQLDump file. Using mySQL Workbench, do a data import on the mySQLDump file. Now open Netbeans and open and save the src and nbproject into a project folder. Once this is done, please download the two plugin's listed in the System requirments.
